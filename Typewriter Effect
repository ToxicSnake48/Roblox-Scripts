-- theres a few ways you can trigger this code, I've listed a few of the more common ones that are used. You should remove the ones you aren't using when you copy this script.
-- You will also need to add a Debounce to stop it from spamming (https://create.roblox.com/docs/scripting/debounce)


-- [UI Button Click:]
local button = script.Parent:WaitForChild("Button") -- "Button" in this case is a TextButton
button.MouseButton1Click:Connect(function()
    typewriterEffect("This is an example of a typewriter effect triggered by a button click!")
end)


-- [On Player Input:]
local UserInputService = game:GetService("UserInputService")

UserInputService.InputBegan:Connect(function(input, gameProcessed)
    if gameProcessed then return end
    if input.KeyCode == Enum.KeyCode.E then -- Change "E" to whatever KeyCode you want
        typewriterEffect("This is an example of a typewriter effect triggered by pressing E!")
    end
end)


-- [On Player Touch:]
local part = workspace:WaitForChild("TriggerPart") --  change to the path of your trigger
local player = game.Players.LocalPlayer

part.Touched:Connect(function(hit)
    if hit.Parent == player.Character then -- Checks if the part that touched the object belongs to that specific player
        typewriterEffect("This is an example of a typewriter effect triggered by touching a part!")
    end
end)


-- [RemoteEvent:] 
local ReplicatedStorage = game:GetService("ReplicatedStorage")
local event = ReplicatedStorage:WaitForChild("TypewriterEvent") -- You will need to create a RemoteEvent in ReplicatedStorage. You can name it whatever you want just make sure you change the name to match it.

event.OnClientEvent:Connect(function(message) -- using this you will need to fire it from a script in ServerScriptService.
    typewriterEffect(message)
end)

-- On server, you can fire it like this:
-- event:FireClient(player, "This is an example of a typewriter effect triggered by a remote event!")


-- [on GUI Visible:]
script.Parent:GetPropertyChangedSignal("Visible"):Connect(function()
    if script.Parent.Visible then
        typewriterEffect("This is an example of a typewriter effect triggered because I'm visible")
    end
end)


-- [On ProximityPrompt:]
local promptPart = workspace:WaitForChild("PromptPart") -- Path to part with ProximityPrompt
local prompt = promptPart:WaitForChild("ProximityPrompt")

prompt.Triggered:Connect(function(player)
    typewriterEffect("This is an example of a typewriter effect triggered with a Proximity Prompt!")
end)
